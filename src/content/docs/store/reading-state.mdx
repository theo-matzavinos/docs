## Store.select()

Reading from the store's state is done with the `select` method. It accepts a function that receives the state object and should return the value that we want to read. The `select` method returns an observable that emits the values that the provided function returns.

```ts
class ComponentOrService {
    authToken$ = inject(Store).select((state) => state.auth.token);
}
```

## Selectors

Using the `select` method with the way described above has problems:
- `state` will be of type `any`
- the function will be called for any change to state, even if the part(s) that are used in the function haven't changed
- reusing and combining the selection functions may become tricky
- even if we manage to reuse and combine these functions there is no memoization (caching) of their results

To solve these issues we use selectors.
- They receive values that are correctly typed (no `any`).
- They only re-run if any of their input values have changed.
- It's easy to reuse and combine them as it's a built-in feature.
- Their results are memoized (if their input values haven't changed they return the previous result) so it's inexpensive to call them multiple times. 

### createFeatureSelector

Assuming that we registered a part of state with a key and a reducer (see [Registering reducers](../updating-state/#registering-reducers)) we use the `createFeatureSelector` function to create a selector that selects that part. It accepts the key that we want to select and is generic so we can provide the type of this part of state.

```ts
// selectAuthState: (state: any) => AuthState
export const selectAuthState = createFeatureSelector<AuthState>(authFeatureKey);
```

### createSelector

The `createSelector` function accepts 1 or more selectors and a function that receives the results of those input selectors and returns the value that we want to select.

```ts
export const selectAuthToken = createSelector(selectAuthState, (authState) => authState.token);
```

In the example above the type of `authState` will `AuthState`.

We can provide any selector as input (not just the result of `createFeatureSelector`).

```ts
export const selectUserIsLoggedIn = createSelector(selectAuthToken, (token) => token != null);
```

We can provide any number of input selectors (at least 1).

```ts
export type GameState = {
    player1: number;
    player2: number;
}

export const selectGameState = createFeatureSelector<GameState>(gameFeatureKey);

export const selectPlayer1Score = createSelector(selectGameState, (gameState) => gameState.player1);

export const selectPlayer2Score = createSelector(selectGameState, (gameState) => gameState.player2);

export const selectWinner = createSelector(selectPlayer1Score, selectPlayer2Score, (player1, player2) => {
    if (player1 > player2) {
        return 'player 1';
    }

    if (player1 < player2) {
        return 'player 2';
    }

    return 'draw';
});
```

Finally we can use our selectors in our components/services to read values from state.

```ts
export class ComponentOrService {
    winner$ = inject(Store).select(selectWinner);
}
```
