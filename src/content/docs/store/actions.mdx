Actions describe unique events that happen in the application. All actions have a `type` property which must be unique with the format `[Event Source] Event Name`.

## createAction

The simplest way to create an action is to use the `createAction` function. It requires a string that defines the `type` of the action. This returns a function that when called returns instances of this action.

```ts
import { createAction } from '@ngrx/store';

export const someAction = createAction('[Event Source] Some Action');
```

Actions usually have additional data needed for handling it. We use the `props` function to define the shape of that data.

:::caution
The additional data must always be an object since it will be merged with the base action object.
:::

<Tabs>
    
    <TabItem label="example">
        ```ts
        import { createAction, props } from '@ngrx/store';
        
        export const login = createAction(
          '[Login Page] Login',
          props<{ username: string; password: string }>()
        );
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="pseudocode">
        ```ts
        // createAction and props work somewhat like this
        export const login = (props: { username: string; password: string }) => {
            return {
                type: '[Login Page] Login',
                ...props
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We can then use this in a component or service.

```ts
@Component({...})
export class LoginComponent {
    ...
    login(username: string, password: string) {
        this.store.dispatch(login({ username, password }));
    }
}
```

## createActionGroup

Creating a lot of actions, especially for the same source, can become tedious. The `createActionGroup` function simplifies that process. It accepts the source as a string and a record of event names and their properties. For actions that don't need properties we use the `emptyProps` function.

:::note
`createActionGroup` is preferred over `createAction` even when creating a single action for a source. This makes it easier to add actions later.
:::

```ts
import { createActionGroup, emptyProps, props } from '@ngrx/store';

export const productsPageActions = createActionGroup({
  source: 'Products Page',
  events: {
    'Opened': emptyProps(),
    'Pagination Changed': props<{ page: number; pageSize: number }>(),
  },
});

// Result
//
// productsPageActions: {
//     opened: () => { type: '[Products Page] Opened' },
//     paginationChanged: (props: { page: number; pageSize: number }) => { type: '[Products Page] Opened', page: number; pageSize: number },
// }
```

## Guidelines

In general actions should represent a unique event and should not be reused - the action should be identifiable by its type, not its data.

Actions should represent events and not commands. We are saying that something happened, not requesting for something to happen.

Even if multiple sources dispatch the same action we should create a separate action for each source. This helps with debugging and makes it easier to have different handling for the actions later if necessary.

```ts
// these might look like the same event but they're not

export const navigationMenuActions = createActionGroup({
  source: 'Navigation Menu',
  events: {
    'Logged Out': emptyProps(),
  },
});

export const userDashboardActions = createActionGroup({
  source: 'User Dashboard',
  events: {
    'Logged Out': emptyProps(),
  },
});
```
