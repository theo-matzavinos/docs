import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Creating [selectors](../reading-state) can become tedious, especially if our state has a lot of properties. For that reason we use the `createFeature` function which automagically creates all the basic selectors for us. We basically combine the [reducer and feature key](../updating-state/#registering-reducers) and [selectors](../reading-state) into one definition.

The `createFeature` function accepts an object containing a feature `name`, a feature `reducer` and optionally a function `extraSelectors`. The `extraSelectors` receives an object with all the basic selectors and should return an object with any extra selector we want to create for this feature.

- The basic selectors that are created by `createFeature` are all prefixed with **select**.
- The feature state selector has the **State** suffix and uses the feature name we provided (eg. selectAuthState, selectGameState).
- The property selectors are based on the property names of our state (eg. selectToken, selectPlayer1).

:::note
This is the recommended way of defining state and selectors.

## Creating features

With `createFeature` we can simplify the following:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="game.reducer.ts">
    ```ts
    export type GameState = {
        player1: number;
        player2: number;
    }

    const initialState: GameState = {
        player1: 0,
        player2: 0
    };

    export const gameReducer = createReducer(
        initialState,
        on(gameActions.player1Scored, (state, action): GameState => ({ ...state, player1: state.player1 + action.points })),
        on(gameActions.player2Scored, (state, action): GameState => ({ ...state, player2: state.player2 + action.points })),
        on(gameActions.reset, (): GameState => initialState)
    );

    export const gameFeatureKey = 'game';
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="game.selectors.ts">
    ```ts
    export const selectGameState = createFeatureSelector<GameState>(gameFeatureKey);

    export const selectPlayer1Score = createSelector(selectGameState, (gameState) => gameState.player1);

    export const selectPlayer2Score = createSelector(selectGameState, (gameState) => gameState.player2);

    export const selectWinner = createSelector(selectPlayer1Score, selectPlayer2Score, (player1, player2) => {
        if (player1 > player2) {
            return 'player 1';
        }

        if (player1 < player2) {
            return 'player 2';
        }

        return 'draw';
    });
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Into this:
```ts
    import { createFeature, createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';

    export type GameState = {
        player1: number;
        player2: number;
    }

    const initialState: GameState = {
        player1: 0,
        player2: 0
    };

    export const gameFeature = createFeature({
        name: 'game',
        reducer: createReducer(
            initialState,
            on(gameActions.player1Scored, (state, action): GameState => ({ ...state, player1: state.player1 + action.points })),
            on(gameActions.player2Scored, (state, action): GameState => ({ ...state, player2: state.player2 + action.points })),
            on(gameActions.reset, (): GameState => initialState)
        ),
        extraSelectors({ selectPlayer1, selectPlayer2 }) {
            return {
                selectWinner: createSelector(selectPlayer1, selectPlayer2, (player1, player2) => {
                    if (player1 > player2) {
                        return 'player 1';
                    }

                    if (player1 < player2) {
                        return 'player 2';
                    }

                    return 'draw';
                }),
            };
        }
    });

    // const gameFeature = {
    //     name,                <- Feature name ('game')
    //     reducer,             <- Feature reducer
    //     selectGameState,     <- Feature state selector. Automatically created.
    //     selectPlayer1,       <- Property selector. Automatically created.
    //     selectPlayer2,       <- Property selector. Automatically created.
    //     selectWinner         <- Extra selector. Created by extraSelectors.
    // };
```

## Registering features

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="NgModule API">
    ```ts
    @NgModule({
        imports: [StoreModule.forFeature(gameFeature)],
    })
    export class GameModule {}
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Standalone API">
    ```ts
    import { provideState } from '@ngrx/store';

    export const routes: Route[] = [
        {
            path: 'game',
            providers: [provideState(gameFeature)]
        }
    ];
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Standalone API (main.ts)">
    ```ts
    bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
        providers: [
            provideStore(),
            provideState(gameFeature)
        ],
    });
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Using features

```ts
export class ComponentOrService {
    winner$ = inject(Store).select(gameFeature.selectWinner);
}
```

## Tradeoffs

The `createFeature` function cannot be used for features whose state contains optional properties. In other words, all state properties have to be passed to the initial state object.

So, if the state contains optional properties:
```ts
interface State {
  books: Book[];
  activeBookId?: string;
}

const initialState: State = {
  books: [],
};
```

Each optional symbol (`?`) has to be replaced with `| undefined` and the initial value has to be explicitly initialized with `undefined`:

```ts
interface State {
  books: Book[];
  activeBookId: string | undefined;
}

const initialState: State = {
  books: [],
  activeBookId: undefined,
};
```
