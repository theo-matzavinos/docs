The Store helps us manage global/shared state. It provides us with a single global object where all application state is stored and it enforces an event-driven approach for updating it. We use it for any piece of state that is shared between components (routes) or must be persisted (not destroyed) between navigations.

## Key concepts

- Actions that describe unique events.
- Reducers that handle events and update the state.
- Selectors that are used to read from the store and compute derived values.
- Effects for logic that doesn't immediately (or at all) affect state.
