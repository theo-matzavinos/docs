The Store helps us manage global/shared state. It provides us with a single global object where all application state is stored and it enforces an event-driven approach for updating it. We use it for any piece of state that is shared between components (routes) or must be persisted (not destroyed) between navigations.

## Key concepts

- Actions that describe unique events.
- Reducers that handle events and update the state.
- Selectors that are used to read from the store and compute derived values.
- Effects for logic that doesn't immediately (or at all) affect state.

## Services

`Store` is the main service. It's used to dispatch actions with the `dispatch` method and read from state with the `select` method.

`Actions` is basically an observable that emits all the actions dispatched from the `Store`. It's mainly used in [effects](./side-effects).
