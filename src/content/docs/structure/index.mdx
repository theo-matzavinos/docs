## Sub-domains

The project is split into sub-domains.

### Domain library

Store, services, dtos, domain logic.

### Feature libraries

Features.

### Shell library

Routing, layout.

### API library

Expose parts of sub-domain to other sub-domains.

### UI libraries

Domain-specific shared libraries.

## Shared libraries

Generic shared libraries.

## Cross-domain actions

Actions that are dispatched from one domain that affect state of another domain are defined in the domain that owns the state and exported from the `api` library. This is done to avoid circular imports.

    <TabItem label="auth/domain/actions.ts">
        ```ts
        export const userDashboardAuthActions = createActionGroup({
            source: 'User Dashboard',
            events: {
                Logout: emptyProps()
            }
        });
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="auth/api/index.ts">
        ```ts
        export { userDashboardAuthActions } from '@project-name/auth/domain';
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="account/features/dashboard/user-dashboard.component.ts">
        ```ts
        import { userDashboardAuthActions } from '@project-name/auth/api';

        @Component({...})
        export class UserDashboardComponent {
            private store = inject(Store);

            logout() {
                this.store.dispatch(userDashboardAuthActions.logout());
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>

## Rules

`domain` libraries can only import:
- `api` libraries of other domains
- `shared` libraries

`feature` libraries can only import:
- the `domain` library of the sub-domain they belong to
- `ui` libraries of the sub-domain they belong to
- `api` libraries of other domains
- `shared` libraries

`api` libraries can only import:
- any library of the sub-domain they belong to
- `api` libraries of other domains
- `shared` libraries

`shell` libraries can only import:
- the `domain` library of the sub-domain they belong to
- `feature` libraries of the sub-domain they belong to
- `ui` libraries of the sub-domain they belong to
- `api` libraries of other domains
- `shared` libraries

`ui` libraries can only import:
- the `domain` library of the sub-domain they belong to
- `ui` libraries of the sub-domain they belong to
- `api` libraries of other domains
- `shared` libraries

`shared` libraries can only import:
- `shared` libraries
